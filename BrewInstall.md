# Install Brew

Original link: https://brew.sh

**Thirst thing** we have to do is **install brew**

```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
$ echo ' eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)'  >> /Users/jasonnewton/ .zprofile eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
```

**Check if this actually works**

``` 
$ brew help
```
