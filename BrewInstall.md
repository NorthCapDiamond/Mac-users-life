# Install Brew

Original link: https://brew.sh

**Thirst thing** we have to do is **install brew**

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
You're gonna catch Warning... If you want brew to be in your $PATH, just copy/paste the solution from this warning.

**Check if this actually works**

``` 
brew help
```
That's it for today)
